how much fruit application, built using react.

View live site at howmuchfruit.com

**Overview **

Find out how much you weigh, in fruit. I wanted to create a SPA(Single Page Application) that would allow a user to find out their weight in fruit.

**Project Brief**

A user chooses a measurement, either Stone, KGs or Pounds. Enters in their weight and then converts that into how much they would weigh in different types of fruit.

**Technologies**

For this project I used the following technologies:
HTML5
CSS
JavaScript
React
JSON
Git
GitHub
Figma - Wireframing

**Trello**

I used Trello to keep track of what needed to be done. This helped break up the SPA(Single Page Application) into more manageable tasks

**Challenges and Problems**

There were some features I didnt know how to add but after googling the problems I faced I worked out how to add these features within the application.

**Wins**

Even though the styling took far longer than expected,I had an idea of how I wanted this projects UI to look. I feel like  I have got it spot on to the designs that I created in Figma.

**Future Features**

Keep a log of recent measurements using local storage. 

Email/SMS  or Social Media integration so uses can share with other people and get them involved.
